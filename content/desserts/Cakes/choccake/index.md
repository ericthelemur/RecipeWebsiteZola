Pre­heat the oven to 180°C. Grease and line two 18cm sandwich tins.
Sieve the flour, cocoa, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the sugar and mix well. make a well in centre and add the syrup, eggs, oil and yoghurt. Beat well until smooth.
Spoon the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25­30 minutes until risen and firm to the touch. remove from oven, turn out onto a cooling rack, leave to cool.
To make the icing place the butter in a bowl and beat until soft. Gradually sift and beat in the icing sugar and then add enough milk/water until soft (if you add to much milk/water just sift some more icing sugar in) make the icing fluffy and spreadable.
Finally sandwich the cakes together with the icing and the cover the cake in the rest of the icing. use a fork to put some patterns on the top if needed, or sprinkle with decorations.
