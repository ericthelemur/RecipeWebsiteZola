Set the oven to gas mark 4 or 180Â°C. Grease and line two 18cm sandwich tins.
To make the cake: Beat the butter. Add the remaining ingredients to it and beat until smooth. Divide mixture between sandwich tins, and level surface.
Bake cakes in the centre of oven for 30-35 mins, or until they have risen and feel just firm to the touch in the centre.
When cakes are cooked, remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Sandwich together with 2 tbsp. lemon curd spread between the layers.
To make the icing: Beat butter until very soft, then add remaining ingredients and beat well until fluffy. Spread over the top and sides of the cake.
