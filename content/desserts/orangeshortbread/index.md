1. Put the flour, orange zest and butter in a large bowl and knead until it resembles fine breadcrumbs (if it is too thick, add some flour). Add the sugar, mix gently and bring the dough together with your hands.
1. Roll the dough onto a lightly floured surface until 1cm thick, then transfer to a baking tray lined with baking paper.
1. Leave the shortbread in the fridge for 10 mins to rest, while pre-heating the oven to 160°C/140°C fan. Bake for 23-25 mins until golden brown, then sprinkle with sugar.
1. While still warm, cut it into 8cmx2cm biscuits, trimming off excess, and leave to cool.
