1. Break egg into a wide bowl. Add the milk and a few good shakes of cinnamon
1. Spread a small amount of oil on a frying pan and place it on medium heat. Mix the contents of the bowl together, ensuring the egg is well beaten.
1. Position your bowl next to your pan and take your first piece of bread and quickly place it in the mixture, flip it and place it in again, then place it in the frying pan.
1. Brown both sides of the bread (~2 mins per side), ensuring the bread doesn't stick to the pan. Repeat with the rest of the bread. If you are doing a large amount of bread, place slices in a warm oven as they are completed to maintain heat.
1. Serve with cinnamon, brown sugar and syrup (ideally maple syrup).
