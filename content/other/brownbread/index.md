1. Grease tin (bread) or baking tray (rolls) with oil.
1. Mix the flour, salt and yeast in a bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to mix. Add the water and stir to form a soft dough.
1. Knead on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth. Place in an oiled bowl, cover loosely in a plastic bag and leave in a warm place.
1. Once the dough has risen to double its original size (~40mins-1 hr, depending on temperature), knead again until smooth.
1. Shape dough into loaf and place in tin (for rolls, shape into 8 rolls and place on baking tray). Leave in a warm place to rise (again loosely covered in a plastic bag) for another half an hour. During rising, preheat oven to 200°C / gas mark 7.
1. Bake in oven for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown. Remove the loaf from tin and leave to cool on a wire rack.
