1. Pan-fry the onion over a medium heat a splash of olive oil. After a few minutes, add the bacon and continue to fry for a few more minutes.
1. Cook the spaghetti in the salted boiling water until al dente. Once the bacon is starting to crisp up, remove the frying pan from the heat and set to one side.
1. While the spaghetti is cooking, mix the egg with the parmesan in a bowl and add lots of cracked black pepper.
1. Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it, retaining some of the starchy water separately. Return to the pan, and start stirring the egg yolks and parmesan mixture into it. The heat from the pan and the pasta will start to cook the egg and by adding just a few tablespoons of the starchy pasta water it will transform into a silky smooth sauce.
1. Mix in the onion and bacon mixture, and serve immediately on a warm plate. Garnish with a grating of parmesan, if you like and enjoy!
