1. Wash and peel the potatoes, then cut them into chunks (approx. the size of an egg). Boil potatoes in a pan of water for 10-15 mins until soft.
1. Remove the spine and skin of the sardines, if not already done, then mash with a fork (donâ€™t worry about small amounts of left over skin and small bones).
1. When potatoes are soft, drain and mash. Add the butter and some pepper for seasoning. If the mash is too firm, add a small amount of milk.
1. Preheat a frying pan at a low heat, and coat pan in olive oil. Mix the sardines into the mash.
1. Cover a large plate with flour, to coat the fishcakes with. Split the mash and sardines mix into [6] lumps, of approximately a heaped tablespoon. Shape each ca nto a cylinder of around 3 inches across and 1 inch deep.
1. Raise the heat of the pan, and place the cakes onto the pan, to brown each side for about 3-5 mins each.
1. Serve with baked beans and vegetables.
