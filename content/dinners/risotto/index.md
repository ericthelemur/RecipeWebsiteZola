1. Boil kettle & make stock in measuring jug - 300ml boiling water plus cube, stir.
    - Note: if making more than 2 portions, use 2 cubes and more water.
2. Weigh out the rice into a spare bowl.
3. Finely chop onion, heat pan, add 1 tablespoon olive oil & heat, then add onion, fry stirring for a few mins. It doesn’t need to be really browned.
4. While onion cooks, wash, peel and chop carrot and parsnip into fairly small pieces. Put peas ready in a bowl, wash &amp; slice green beans 1-2 cm if using.
5. Turn down heat, add measured rice to pan, you may need a little extra oil. Stir, aiming to coat most of the rice with oil slightly.
6. Add stock to pan, stir for a few mins, once pan bubbling/boiling, turn down to simmer & apply lid.
7. After 5 mins, stir & check rice. A little more water out the kettle might be needed, but be careful not to add a lot of water, so as to get the flavour from the stock, making it different from plain boiled rice.
8. Put chopped carrot & parsnip in steamer basket & add on top of pan, reapplying lid. 
    - Add salmon too, if using. Or bake the salmon in foil in the oven for about 20 mins.
    - If using prawns/ leftovers best to add to the rice for the last 3-4 mins.
9. Rice usually takes about 15-20 mins in total, needs checking/stirring a few times - add a little liquid as needed.
10. Add peas/green beans to steamer basket for last 5 mins, or can add directly to rice or microwave/steam separately.
11. Mix all together in hot pan, leave in pan off the heat for a few mins to develop the flavour. Serve with salmon on the side, or prawns/leftovers on top. Salmon can also be flaked & mixed in.
