1. Mix the flour, salt and yeast in a bowl. Add the oil and water. Stir to form a soft dough.
1. Knead on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth. Place in another bowl, cover loosely in a plastic bag and leave in a warm place.
1. Once the dough has risen to double its original size, knead again until smooth. Then, thinly roll out the dough into two circular bases, about 25cm across, on a lightly floured surface.
1. Place the bases onto the sheets and leave to rise. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°c (gas mark 7). Mix the passata with the purée and oregano. Season to taste.
1. Spread the mixture evenly over each base. Break up ham and cheese into small pieces. Scatter the pieces over the pizza and drizzle it with olive oil.
1. Bake for around 10-15 minutes until crusts are pale golden and firm. Remove from oven and serve.
