1. Add the oil to a saucepan at a medium heat. Add the onions and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Then add the mince.
1. Cook, while stirring, until the mince is well browned (be careful not to burn the mince). Once browned, drain off any fat.
1. Add the chopped tomatoes, purée, grated carrot stock cube (either broken up in hands or dissolved in warm water) and the oregano with a pinch of pepper and stir well. Bring to a boil and then reduce the temperature to simmer gently for 15 minutes.
1. Start cooking your rice now, if you are doing chilli now, otherwise wait 10 mins to start spaghetti, cook rice for ~20-25 mins and spaghetti for ~10-12 mins (see packet)
1. After the 15 minutes has passed, split the sauce in half, into a separate pan (use the larger one for chilli). Add the beans, chickpeas and chilli powder to the chilli, and simmer both for 5-10 mins more.
1. Serve one portion of bolognese or chilli, and portion the rest into boxes. Leave the rest to cool, then freeze.
