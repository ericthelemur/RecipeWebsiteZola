1. Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the centre and add the egg and half the milk. Beat the egg and milk together with the flour and salt.
1. When smooth, beat in the remainder of the milk.
1. Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Spread some oil thinly over the surface of the pan using a piece of kitchen roll and briefly heat, then pour in enough batter to cover the pan's surface. Spread into a thin, even layer. Cook for ~30 seconds or until the under side is browned.
1. Flip with spatula and cook the other side until golden brown. Stack the pancakes on a plate in a warm oven and cover with foil to keep warm. Serve with lemon juice and sugar, or with your favorite topping!
